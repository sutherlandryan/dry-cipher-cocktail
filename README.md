## Overview
The Dry Cipher is a modern rum highball with a covert edge — a layered combination of good aged rum, dry vermouth, Coke Zero, and two-tier bitters. Balanced, aromatic, and dangerously smooth.

---

## Ingredients
- 1 full can (355 ml) Coke Zero  
- 20–100 g good aged rum (adjust to mission parameters)  
- ½ cap (approx. 5 ml) dry vermouth  
- 4 g orange bitters (~4 dashes)  
- 1 g aromatic bitters (~1 dash)  
- Ice as needed

## Method
1. Fill a tall glass with ice.
2. Add rum, vermouth, and both bitters.
3. Top with Coke Zero.
4. Stir gently.
5. Serve without garnish — let the flavor speak.
