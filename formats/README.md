## ðŸ“‚ Files

### **dry-cipher.json**
- **Use for:** Modern APIs, cocktail databases, and systems that can import structured JSON.
- **Why:** Includes all metadata (name, author, license, creation date, full ingredient list, and method).
- **Import tip:** Many bar inventory and cocktail apps (e.g., Mixology Tech, custom API scripts) can consume JSON directly.

---

### **dry-cipher.csv**
- **Use for:** Simple or legacy POS systems, spreadsheet management, and auto-bar pump mapping.
- **Why:** CSV is the most widely compatible format. Can be opened in Excel, Google Sheets, or imported into POS software.
- **Import tip:** Each row = one ingredient with its amount, unit, and notes.  
- **Header columns:** `Drink Name`, `Ingredient`, `Amount`, `Unit`, `Notes`

---

### **dry-cipher.xml**
- **Use for:** Automated bartender machines or systems with XML-based recipe import.
- **Why:** XML is still used in certain closed or proprietary bar systems (e.g., Barsys, Drinkworks, Bartesian).
- **Import tip:** The `<cocktail>` root element contains `<ingredients>` with `<ingredient>` child elements for each component.
